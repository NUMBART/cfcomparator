# CF COMPARATOR  
I made this project to get a more in-depth assessment of a users performance in codeforces contests. The features currently supported are - 
1) You can see the average time in which contestants in a certain rank range(say ranked 1600 - 1650) submitted a particular problem. In the image given you can select the problems you want to look at. Also here upon hovering the mouse on the black line we can see that user with a rank of arond 1700 submited B by the 17th minute.

2) Predicting how hard the problem(problem rating) that you barely managed to solve or just missed towards the end actually was, right after the contest rating changes(official problem ratings take up to a few days to be declared)
